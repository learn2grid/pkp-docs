# What is a theme?

A theme controls the look and feel of your journal or press, including the colors, layout and typography. A theme is a type of plugin for OJS 3.0+ and OMP 1.2+ which allows you to override the default template files and add your own CSS.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with writing and using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) to build websites. The theming platform follows common practices for overriding templates and injecting CSS styles that you may be familiar with from other content management platforms, such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). 

If these are new concepts for you, we recommend reviewing the Customize the Look of Your Journal
section of [Learning OJS for Journal Managers](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/journal-managers/en/appearance) to get started.

## Locating the Theme Plugins

You will find any themes you have installed under the `/plugins/themes/` directory in your OJS or OMP installation. Each application ships with at least one theme, the **Default Theme**. You can learn more about this and other themes under the [Themes](themes.md) section of this guide.

The following sections in this guide will introduce you to the main components of a theme, providing an orientation to the file structure and contents which make up a theme.
