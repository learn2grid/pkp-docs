# Appendix: Disabling new submissions in OJS

To disable new submissions to the journal, you will need to be in the Journal Manager role. You can do it in three ways:

- Disable submissions to the journal, [as described in the Learning OJS 3 guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/journal-managers/en/policies#disable-submissions)
- Disable submission per section [as described in the Learning OJS 3 guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/journal-managers/en/policies#sections)
- Remove the “Make a Submission Block” from the user interface in [Settings > Website > Appearance > Sidebar Management](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#appearance) and/or disable the “Make a Submission Block” in [Settings > Website > Plugins](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#installed-plugins)
